    "Over the past few months, I've been spending time here and there learning some of the basics of Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and how they are used together in PK/PD models to understand drug pharmacology. I've also been developing a PK/PD-focused add-on for the [PySB](https://pysb.org/) modeling framework, [pysb-pkpd](https://github.com/blakeaw/pysb-pkpd), which I believe to be a great option for programmatically constructing and executing various types of compartmental PK/PD models in Python.

    "## What is PK/PD modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the specifics of using [PySB](https://pysb.org/) and [pysb-pkpd](https://github.com/blakeaw/pysb-pkpd), we'll briefly review some basic PK/PD modeling concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "PK/PD models are mathematical models used to study the intricate relationships between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics[<sup>1-3</sup>](#references), two essential branches of pharmacology that study what drugs do in and to the body. **Pharmacokinetics (PK)** describes the processes that affect drug concentration in the body[<sup>1,3,4</sup>](#references), including key processes related to how a drug enters the body or the circulatory system (i.e., absorption), how it moves through the body and partitions amongst the different tissues or organs (i.e., distribution), how the body chemically alters or breaks down the drug (i.e., metabolism), and how the drug or it's metabolites exit the body (i.e., excretion). You'll often see the acronym **ADME** used as an abbreviation for the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion,[<sup>4,5</sup>](#references); other similar acronyms may emphasize other important factors too (e.g., _ABCD_ or _ADMET_)[<sup>5</sup>](#references) **Pharmacodynamics (PD)** characterizes the relationship between drug concentration (or dose) and the resulting pharmacological effect<sup>1,3</sup>. Another way to think about it is that PK processes describe what the _body does to a drug_ after it is administered[<sup>1,6</sup>](#references), while PD describes what a _drug does to the body_. Importantly, PK/PD modeling integrates PK and PD to describe how the pharmacological effect of a drug changes over time[<sup>1-3</sup>](#references). \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, for a given drug dose[<sup>1</sup>](#references):\n",
    "  * PK = concentration vs. time\n",
    "  * PD = effect vs. concentration\n",
    "  * PK/PD = effect vs. time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of PK/PD Models\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various approaches to PK/PD modeling that can be employed depending on the type of data available, how well we understand the biological mechanisms of a drug, as well as other aspects of a drug's behavior and response. Here, we'll touch on three categories of PK/PD models that can be implemented using PySB and pysb-pkpd: compartmental models[<sup>4,7-9</sup>](#references), mechanistic/semi-mechanistic models[<sup>10,11</sup>](#references), and quantitative systems pharmacology/toxicology models[<sup>12-14</sup>](#references).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compartmental PK/PD Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Compartmental models partition the body into distinct hypothetical compartments[<sup>4,7-9</sup>](#references), each potentially representing a biological system in the body like the circulatory system, tissues, or organs. A drug moves between, or _distributes_ across, the compartments, approximating distribution in the body. These models may also include drug absorption and typically include drugs exiting the body through clearance or elimination (see: Additional PK terms). The number of compartments encodes the granularity level with which the drug distribution is modeled. Common compartmental models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **One-Compartment Model**: Treats the body as a single compartment, a reasonable approximation for drugs that distribute quickly and uniformly throughout the body[<sup>4,7,9,15</sup>](#references). \n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Two-Compartment Model**: Breaks the body into a Central and a Peripheral compartment[<sup>4,7,9,15</sup>](#references). The Central compartment typically represents the circulatory system and well-perfused tissues, while the Peripheral compartment represents other tissues and organs that aren't well-perfused. This model is useful when there is a delay in the drug distribution from the circulatory system to other tissues. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Three-Compartment Model**: Builds on the two-compartment model by adding a second peripheral compartment[<sup>4,9</sup>](#references). This third compartment (e.g., Deep Peripheral, Deep Tissue, or Slow Peripheral), typically represents tissues with slower distribution kinetics, which is beneficial when a drug has multiple distribution phases because it distributes at different rates to different tissues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In one-, two-, and three-compartment models, the compartments are really just theoretical constructs that facilitate empirical estimation of key PK parameters through fitting to clinical or other experimental data rather than a true representation of the body[<sup>4</sup>](#references). A drug's plasma concentration-time profile can suggest which model may be most appropriate[<sup>9,15</sup>](#references). In some cases, two- and three-compartment models may also be extended to have a separate _Effect_ compartment that can be used to capture an indirect link between drug concentration and effects[<sup>1,8</sup>](#references). \n",
    "\n",
    "More complex distribution scenarios between tissues and organs can be captured by increasing the number of compartments, as seen in physiologically-based PK (PBPK) models[<sup>16,17</sup>](#references). \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Mechanistic/Semi-Mechanistic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanistic and semi-mechanistic models build on compartmental PK/PD models by incorporating more details of the drug's mechanism of action and the underlying biology that can help connect drug behavior with important biomarkers[<sup>10,11</sup>](#references). They can also be used to link effects with the dynamics of complex processes that can't be easily measured in experiments. For example, in classical [receptor theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_theory), there is a pharmacodynamic relationship between the observed effect and receptor occupancy (RO). A semi-mechanistic model could incorporate additional mechanisms related to drug binding at the target receptor and the receptor's activation or inhibition, as well as processes like receptor turnover or other downstream products of receptor targeting. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantitative Systems Pharmacology/Toxicology Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models further build on mechanistic/semi-mechanistic PK/PD modeling with concepts from systems biology[<sup>12,13</sup>](#references). In QSP models, drug effects can be considered to arise out of complex networks of interactions that form a biological system and may incorporate additional details of biochemical signaling pathways, disease processes, and a drug's mechanism of action. Quantitative systems toxicology (QST) models similarly incorporate ideas of systems biology but focus on understanding and quantifying drug side effects as opposed to primary drug pharmacology[<sup>13,14</sup>](#references).       \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional PK terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few more important terms used in PK modeling and analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Dose**/**Dosage**: _Dose_ is how much drug is administered at a particular time[<sup>18</sup>](#references), while _Dosage_ refers to multiple doses taken over a period of time with a given frequency. Note that the administration route (e.g., oral vs. I.V.) along with the dose and/or dosage are critical considerations for any particular dosing strategy[<sup>19</sup>](#references).\n",
    "  * **Bioavailability ($\\beta$)**: the fraction of a drug dose that gets absorbed and can reach the site of action[<sup>5,20</sup>](#references). Often associated with administering a drug via an oral route where not all of the drug will enter circulation before being metabolized or excreted.\n",
    "  * **Volume of distribution ($V_d$)**: the theoretical volume into which an administered drug would be distributed to yield a measured plasma concentration[<sup>15,21,22</sup>](#references): $concentration = dose / V_d$. It can provide insight into a drug's tendency to stay in the plasma or disperse into tissues and organs. Importantly, $V_d$ may be not a fixed value. It can also be linked to compartment volumes in compartmental modeling. For instance, in a one-compartment model, $V_d$ equals the central compartment volume[<sup>15</sup>](#references). However, in multicompartment models, the relationship is more complicated. \n",
    "  * **Elimination**: removal of the drug from the body by processes like metabolism and excretion[<sup>23,24</sup>](#references). In PK models it is often modeled as a linear process with first-order reaction kinetics: i.e., _linear elimination_.\n",
    "  * **Clearance (CL)**: removal of drug from the plasma measured as the volume of plasma 'cleared' (i.e., free of drug) per unit time[<sup>15,24,25</sup>](#references). Or, alternatively, as the rate of drug _elimination_ (amount/time) divided by the drug's plasma concentration (amount/volume). With a compartmental model and assuming linear elimination, an associated first-order rate constant for the corresponding elimination process can be expressed as $k = CL / V_i $ with clearance $CL$ from a compartment with volume $V_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PD functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Emax** class of functions is a common choice of PD functions when modeling a _direct effect_ (or _direct link_) in a PK/PD model[<sup>1,8,26</sup>](#references). These functions relate drug concentration (or dose) to effect using a non-linear sigmoid function, which is also common in biochemistry ([Hill or Hill-Langmuir equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_equation_(biochemistry))) and classic receptor theory (e.g., Clark equation): \n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Emax** - $E = E_{max} \\left[Drug\\right] / (\\left[Drug\\right] + EC_{50})$, where $E_{max}$ is termed the maximum effect and $EC_{50}$ is the concentration at which effect is at half-maximum[<sup>1,26</sup>](#references). If considering a baseline effect $E_0$, it can be expanded to $E = E_0 \\pm E_{max} \\left[Drug\\right] / (\\left[Drug\\right] + EC_{50})$.\n",
    "  * **Sigmoidal Emax** (or Sigmoid Emax) - the more generic form of the Emax function[<sup>1,26</sup>](#references): $E = E_{max} \\left[Drug\\right]^n / (\\left[Drug\\right]^n + EC_{50}^n)$, where $n$ the Hill slope and determines how the steepness of the sigmoid function jump. If considering a baseline effect $E_0$, it can be expanded to $E = E_0 \\pm E_{max} \\left[Drug\\right]^n / (\\left[Drug\\right]^n + EC_{50}^n)$. Note that the first **Emax** function is a special case of this one in which $n=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other possible PD functions include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * **Linear Effect Model** - the effect is just a linear function of drug concentration[<sup>1</sup>](#references): $E = m \\left[ Drug \\right]$ with slope $m$ or $E = m \\left[ Drug \\right] + E_0$ if considering a baseline effect $E_0$.\n",
    "  * **Log-linear Effect Model** - the effect varies linearly with the logarithm of the concentration[<sup>1</sup>](#references): $E = m \\log \\left[ Drug \\right] + b$ with slope $m$ and intercept $b$.\n",
    "  * **Fixed-Effect Model** - the effect has a fixed magnitude that only occurs after reaching some threshold concentration[<sup>1</sup>](#references): $E = E_{fixed}, \\,\\, \\left[ Drug \\right] > \\left[ Drug \\right]_{threshold}$ and zero otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: In cases where there's a delay between drug concentration and its effect (_indirect link_; e.g., when peak concentration and peak effect don't align), it's possible to use a separate _Effect_ compartment in conjunction with a direct effect PD function to model this scenario[<sup>1,8</sup>](#references).

    "## A Quick Intro to PySB Models\n",
    "\n",
    "[PySB](https://pysb.org/) is a Python-based framework for systems biology modeling that allows users to programmatically encode and simulate mathematical models of complex biological systems using ordinary differential equations, stochastic differential equations, and network-free modeling approaches. PySB was originally developed for reaction modeling of intricate biochemical systems[<sup>27</sup>](#references), such as cell signaling pathways, adopting a rule-based approach that builds on the rule-based modeling platforms [BioNetGen](https://bionetgen.org/) and [Kappa](https://kappalanguage.org/). In rule-based modeling, a model is encoded using a simplified set of pattern-based _rules_ that describe biochemical actions (e.g., _Protein A binds Protein B_) rather than an explicit enumeration of all the reactions and molecular/complex species[<sup>27,28</sup>](#references). When using differential equation methods, the model rules are converted into a complex reaction network from which all the differential equations are then generated. This eliminates the need for the modeler to explicitly define all the differential equations of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "What sets PySB apart though is its Pythonic approach in which model components are Python class-based objects[<sup>27</sup>](#references), allowing models to be expressed as Python programs rather than separate domain-specific language files. This design choice enables seamless integration, manipulation, and execution of PySB models within Python workflows. Furthermore, it promotes modularity and reusability by facilitating the encapsulation of recurring biochemical actions into reusable _macros_[<sup>27</sup>](#references). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to PySB, I recommend starting with the PySB tutorial available at https://pysb.org/tutorials/ and then the more in-depth tutorial at https://pysb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html. These are excellent resources for beginners to learn the fundamentals of building and executing PySB models. You can also check out various example PySB models at https://github.com/pysb/pysb/tree/master/pysb/examples.\n",

    "[pysb-pkpd](https://github.com/blakeaw/pysb-pkpd) is a PySB add-on that introduces the language of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to PySB models. It achieves this by encoding PK actions, PD functions, and drug dosing into specialized PySB macros, simplifying the creation of compartmental PK/PD models. Moreover, PySB provides a natural foundation for expanding these models into mechanistic PK/PD models and more complex quantitative systems pharmacology/toxicology (QSP/QST) models.\n",

    "In this first case study, we will construct two different versions of a two-compartment PK model with an Emax PD function. We will build the first version exclusively using the standard PySB framework, and in the second we will use PySB with the pysb-pkpd add-on. This case study will provide a practical, side-by-side comparison, highlighting the added efficiency and pharmacological context that pysb-pkpd brings to PySB-based PK/PD model construction. "

    "**Some Notes:** The circles representing the different cell types are illustrative and do not represent separate compartments; the associated surface proteins are assumed to be distributed uniformly throughout the compartment (well-mixed approximation). All of the free cell surface proteins undergo zero-order synthesis and 1st-order degradation; when bound, PD-1 undergoes first-order degradation. Pembro in both the free and sPD-1-bound forms are cleared from the central compartment. Pembro binds both PD-1 and sPD-1 via reversible binding reactions in all compartments. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 only happens in the tumor compartment. "

    "## Closing Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we covered the basics of PK/PD modeling and did a quick overview of the PySB modeling framework. Then, we dove into creating and simulating dynamic PK/PD models of drug behavior and response using PySB and pysb-pkpd by working through two illustrative case studies. With these case studies, we demonstrated the power of combining PySB with the pysb-pkpd add-on to programmatically construct and execute different types of PK/PD models, such as compartmental models, mechanistic/semi-mechanistic models, and quantitative systems pharmacology/toxicology models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're an aspiring PK/PD modeler, a Python enthusiast, or simply curious about pharmacology, I hope you've found this post helpful and informative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's your turn. Go out and experiment more with PySB and pysb-pkpd, construct your own models, or explore other real-world PK/PD modeling applications. And, if you know someone else who might find this post useful, please share! \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that’s it. Thanks for stopping by! If you have questions or comments, feel free to [email me](mailto:blakeaw1102@gmail.com) or hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blakewilson3/).\n",
